    <p>Q1: How do I play Tic Tac Toe on your website?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="font-Regular text-xl mt-6 ml-10 mr-20">
    <p>A: Playing Tic Tac Toe on our website is easy! Simply visit the game page, and you can start a new game by clicking the "1 Vs 1" or "Vs Computer" buttons. To make a move, click on the square where you want to place your X or O. The game will automatically alternate between X and O turns. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!</p>

    <p>Q2: Can I play Tic Tac Toe with a friend on your website?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="font-Regular text-xl mt-6 ml-10 mr-20">
    <p>A: Currently, our website supports single-player mode only. However, we are actively working on introducing a two-player feature in the future, allowing you to enjoy the game with friends. Stay tuned for updates!!</p>

    <p>Q3: What happens if the game ends in a tie?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="font-Regular text-xl mt-6 pl-80 pr-5 ">
    <p>A: If all the squares on the board are filled, and neither player has achieved three in a row, the game is declared a tie. In Tic Tac Toe, this is commonly known as a "draw" or "cat's game." If this happens, you can simply start a new game and try again!</p>

  <div class="font-bold text-3xl text-right pr-10">
    <p>Q4: Is there a way to reset the game if I want to start over?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="font-Regular text-xl mt-6 pl-80 pr-5">
    <p>A: Yes, there is! To start a new game and reset the board, simply click the "New Game" button. This will clear the current board and allow you to begin a fresh round of Tic Tac Toe. It's a great way to rematch or start a new game with a different opponent.
